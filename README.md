On the basis that this readme.md file explains what the repository will aim to provide here goes.

In January VMware released their cloud builder appliance.

Use of the appliance is dependent upon a number of infrastructure components being available if the automated build is to be successful.

Since GSL will be exploring the potential for the appliance using hardware not listed on the HCL (but known to work) there is an assumption that the hardware may need to be completely reset during experimentation.

This repository will contain Powershell scripts to build out the pre-requisites for the VVD
